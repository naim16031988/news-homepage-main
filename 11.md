Perfect, thanks for the clarification.

Your goal is to:

When an agent‚Äôs CPU < 1%, and multiple instances exist, find the instances of that agent, select one based on the node with highest energy consumption, and remove it (including from NGINX).

‚∏ª

‚úÖ To help with this, here‚Äôs what you need:

1. A function to:
	‚Ä¢	Query all containers for a given agent (already handled by the placement agent).
	‚Ä¢	Return their:
	‚Ä¢	container_id
	‚Ä¢	ip
	‚Ä¢	port
	‚Ä¢	node_ip (host where the container runs)

2. A function to:
	‚Ä¢	Stop and delete the container remotely via SSH.
	‚Ä¢	Remove its backend from NGINX upstream.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Functions

‚∏ª

üîç Function 1: get_containers_to_remove

This queries your placement agent to get all containers for a given agent.

def get_containers_to_remove(placement_agent_url, agent_name):
    try:
        response = requests.get(f"{placement_agent_url}/containers", params={"agent_name": agent_name})
        response.raise_for_status()
        containers = response.json().get("containers", [])
        return containers  # Expecting list of dicts: [{id, ip, port, node_ip}, ...]
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[GetContainers] Error: {e}")
        return []

üîÅ You‚Äôll use this list to pick the container running on the most energy-consuming node.

‚∏ª

üî• Function 2: delete_container_and_update_nginx

This deletes a given container (via SSH) and removes its backend from nginx.conf.

def delete_container_and_update_nginx(container_id, container_ip, port, node_ip, username, password, group):
    # Step 1: Remove backend from nginx
    remove_instance(group, container_ip, port)

    # Step 2: Connect via SSH and delete container
    ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
    ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())

    try:
        ssh.connect(node_ip, username=username, password=password)
        print(f"[Delete] Connected to {node_ip}, removing {container_id}")
        stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command(f"docker rm -f {container_id}")
        print(stdout.read().decode())
        print(stderr.read().decode())
        print(f"[Delete] Container {container_id} deleted successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[Delete] Error deleting container via SSH: {e}")
    finally:
        ssh.close()

‚úÖ Example Usage Flow (inside your autoscaler):

if cpu_usage < threshold_down:
    containers = get_containers_to_remove(placement_agent_url, agent_name)
    if len(containers) > 1:
        # You already sorted nodes by energy, assume `target_node` is the one to clean
        container_to_remove = next((c for c in containers if c["node_ip"] == target_node), None)

        if container_to_remove:
            creds = requests.get(f"{placement_agent_url}/user_credentials",
                                 params={"destination_node": target_node}).json()
            username = creds["username"]
            password = creds["password"]

            delete_container_and_update_nginx(
                container_id=container_to_remove["id"],
                container_ip=container_to_remove["ip"],
                port=container_to_remove["port"],
                node_ip=container_to_remove["node_ip"],
                username=username,
                password=password,
                group=agent_name
            )
    else:
        print("[ScaleDown] Only one container running. Skip scaling down.")

üìù Requirements

To make this work:
	‚Ä¢	Your placement agent /containers?agent_name=... must return:

[
  {
    "id": "container_id",
    "ip": "10.18.6.10",
    "port": 5000,
    "node_ip": "10.18.6.10"
  },
  ...
]

Would you like help updating the /containers endpoint on the placement agent to return that format?
