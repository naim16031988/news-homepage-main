Thanks for the clarification â€” you have a multi-node Docker setup with:
	â€¢	âœ… Two agent containers
	â€¢	âœ… An autoscaler that watches CPU usage and triggers scaling
	â€¢	âœ… A placement agent that decides where and what to deploy
	â€¢	âœ… New agents deployed dynamically on other nodes

â¸»

âœ… Goal

You want the load balancer (NGINX) to:
	â€¢	Be created only when there are 2+ agent instances
	â€¢	Be removed automatically when only 1 agent remains

â¸»

âœ… Recommended Architecture

Hereâ€™s a clean and modular way to handle it:

ðŸ”§ Components

Component	Role
Agent container(s)	Your RL/Flask agents
Placement agent	Decides target node for new instance
Autoscaler	Monitors CPU and requests scaling
NGINX container	Acts as load balancer (dynamic)
Agent discovery service (optional)	Tracks number of agents
Script or controller	Starts/stops NGINX as needed


â¸»

âœ… Integration Plan

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Agents Register Themselves

When an agent container starts, it should:
	â€¢	Send a POST to the placement agent or a discovery API
	â€¢	Register its IP and port (e.g. 192.168.1.100:5000)

Example inside agent:

import requests
requests.post("http://<placement-agent>:8000/register", json={"ip": my_ip, "port": 5000})


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Placement Agent Tracks Active Agents
	â€¢	Keep an in-memory list or use Redis/SQLite
	â€¢	Return current list of agents on /agents

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: NGINX Config Generator + Controller

Write a Python script or lightweight container that:
	1.	Calls the placement agentâ€™s /agents API
	2.	If 2+ agents found:
	â€¢	Create nginx.conf dynamically
	â€¢	Start or reload NGINX
	3.	If only 1 agent remains:
	â€¢	Stop and remove the NGINX container

This can run periodically, or be triggered by your autoscaler.

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: NGINX Reload Without Downtime

Use Docker like this:

docker run --name lb -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro \
  nginx

Reload with:

docker exec lb nginx -s reload

Stop with:

docker rm -f lb

âœ… Summary: Autoscaler + Placement Agent + NGINX Lifecycle

Event	Action
CPU exceeds threshold	Autoscaler asks Placement Agent where to deploy
New agent starts	Registers with Placement Agent
Controller detects 2+ agents	Starts or updates NGINX
Agent removed (scale-down)	Controller sees 1 left â†’ removes NGINX


â¸»

Would you like me to provide:
	â€¢	A sample agent registration API (for Placement Agent)?
	â€¢	The NGINX controller Python script?
	â€¢	Docker Compose setup for all components?

Let me know and Iâ€™ll generate exactly what you need.
